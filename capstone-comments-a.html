<h2><strong> SUBAYBUS: REAL-TIME BUS TRACKING SYSTEM FOR ROXAS CITY, CAPIZ</strong></h2>
<hr>
<p>CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION</p>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Strong contextual grounding in national modernization efforts (PUVMP).</li>
  <li>Clear comparison between Metro Manila and Roxas City systems.</li>
  <li>Use of tabular data to highlight disparities is effective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider adding a brief paragraph on commuter demographics in Roxas City to personalize the need for the system.</li>
  <li>The table comparing features could benefit from a visual (e.g., heatmap or icon-based comparison) if allowed in the format.</li>
  <li>Clarify whether the “local study” cited on satisfaction levels is published or internal - this affects credibility.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Desired State of Technology</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear articulation of route structure and fare system.</li>
  <li>Integration of color-coded routes adds usability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Include a mockup or schematic of the proposed app interface to visualize user interaction.</li>
  <li>Consider referencing accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to strengthen the inclusivity claim.</li>
  <li>Explicitly mention that real-time tracking requires not just software but reliable GPS hardware installed on each PUV. </li>
  <li> Suggest referencing existing models (e.g., LTFRB-approved GPS units) to show feasibility and compliance.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Statement of the Problem</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Well-structured problem statements with operational and user-centric angles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add quantitative estimates (e.g., average waiting time, fleet size) to make the problem more measurable.</li>
  <li>Consider framing the problem in terms of missed opportunities for data-driven governance.</li>
  <li>Include the absence of GPS hardware as a core barrier to real-time visibility. </li>
  <li> Frame it as both a technical and logistical challenge - e.g., lack of funding, standardization, or installation protocols.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Objectives of the Study</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Specific objectives are actionable and aligned with system features.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add an objective related to long-term scalability or integration with national platforms (e.g., DOTr systems).</li>
  <li>Consider rephrasing Objective 5 to include both technical and experiential metrics.</li>
  <li>Add new objective “To identify and integrate suitable GPS hardware for deployment across PUV units, ensuring compatibility with the SUBAYBUS software platform.”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Rich integration of multiple theories (Diffusion of Innovations, TTF, HCI).</li>
  <li>Tables and conceptual linkages are well scaffolded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Include citations directly in the table for easier reference.</li>
  <li>Consider adding a diagram that visually maps the conceptual framework (hardware → software → users) with feedback loops.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Scope and Limitations</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear boundaries and realistic assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Expand on the limitation regarding privacy - mention potential future compliance strategies (e.g., anonymization, encryption).</li>
  <li>Consider adding a note on environmental factors (e.g., weather, road conditions) that may affect GPS accuracy.</li>
  <li>Define whether the study includes procurement, installation, or just simulation of GPS hardware.</li>
  <li> Note any limitations in testing due to hardware availability or budget constraints.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Significance of the Study</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-stakeholder impact is well articulated.</li>
  <li>Quantitative projections (e.g., 40% reduction in wait time) add persuasive power.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Include a brief paragraph on how this study contributes to academic literature or future research.</li>
  <li>Consider adding a visual summary (e.g., stakeholder impact matrix) to reinforce clarity.</li>
  <li>Emphasize how hardware integration enables scalable, replicable systems for other cities. </li>
  <li> Mention potential partnerships with local transport cooperatives or LGUs for hardware rollout.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER II: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Diverse international and local sources.</li>
  <li>Synthesis table effectively identifies gaps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a short paragraph summarizing the unique contribution of SUBAYBUS compared to existing systems.</li>
  <li>Consider grouping literature by technology type (e.g., GPS-based, IoT-based, AI-enhanced) for better thematic flow.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>CHAPTER III: METHODOLOGY</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Agile development rationale is well explained.</li>
  <li>Mixed-methods approach adds depth to evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Include a diagram of the sprint cycle or development timeline for visual clarity.</li>
  <li>Expand on the MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, and Won't-have) prioritization outcomes - what features were deferred and why?</li>
  <li>Include steps for hardware selection, testing, and integration. </li>
  <li> If actual deployment isn’t feasible, propose a simulation or emulation environment to validate GPS data flow.</li>
  <li>Consider adding a brief risk assessment (e.g., hardware failure, user adoption barriers).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Justifications are practical and budget-conscious.</li>
  <li>Use of open-source tools like Leaflet.js is commendable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Include a table comparing chosen tools with alternatives to show decision-making rigor.</li>
  <li>Mention any fallback strategies (e.g., offline mode, caching) for connectivity issues.</li>
  <li>List GPS modules (e.g., Quectel L86, SIM808) with justification for selection - cost, accuracy, ease of integration. </li>
  <li> Mention how data from the GPS device will be transmitted (e.g., via GSM, Wi-Fi, or BLE) and parsed by the backend.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Final Notes</h3>
<p>This proposal is already well-aligned with BSIT capstone standards and  expectations. To elevate it further:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add visual scaffolding where possible (e.g., diagrams, wireframes, flowcharts).</li>
  <li>Start preparing a short pitch version (1–2 pages) for your defense.</li>
  <li>Consider including a brief ethical reflection or sustainability note to round out the social impact.</li>
</ul>
