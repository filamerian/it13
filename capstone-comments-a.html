<h2><strong> SUBAYBUS: REAL-TIME BUS TRACKING SYSTEM FOR ROXAS CITY, CAPIZ</strong></h2>
<hr>
<h3>CHAPTER I – INTRODUCTION</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>I.  Overview of the Current State of Technology</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  This section provides a well-informed perspective on the global application of  GPS, IoT, and data analytics in transportation systems. It highlights a  meaningful contrast between urban centers like Metro Manila and the  underutilization of tracking systems in Roxas City.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Add       localized statistics from Roxas City (e.g., average commuter waiting times       or complaints received) to better contextualize the local problem.</li>
  <li>Briefly       mention the relevance of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program       (PUVMP) in promoting technological upgrades.</li>
  <li>Improve       the flow between the discussion on national-level developments (e.g., Metro       Manila) and local-level issues (Roxas City) to ensure a more logical       transition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Include a table comparing features in Metro Manila transit systems (e.g.,  Buswise, Sakay.ph) with existing Roxas City systems to emphasize modernization  gaps. Reference specific commuter challenges via local government reports or  transport studies. Conclude with a more direct connection between the  identified issues and the proposed system.</p>

  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>II.  Desired State of Technology</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  The proposal clearly describes target features including GPS tracking, mobile  accessibility, route mapping, and user-centric platforms. It effectively  situates the system within the PUVMP framework using Green and Red Bus  color-coded routes.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Describe       which routes or terminals will be prioritized during pilot implementation.</li>
  <li>Clarify       system expansion plans (e.g., support for jeepneys, multicabs, or other       PUVs in future phases).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Use a modular outline to define feature clusters:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Tracking       Module:</strong> Real-time bus location and estimated arrival</li>
  <li><strong>User       Interface Module:</strong> Map visuals, notifications, trip       planning</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics       Module:</strong> Historical data, performance metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>Include  brief visuals or mockups if available.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>III.  Statement of the Problem</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  This section identifies core challenges such as commuter dissatisfaction,  inefficient trip planning, and lack of tracking access. Some repetition  (&quot;extended waiting times&quot;) should be condensed.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Reframe       listed issues as formal problem statements with direct consequences (e.g.,       “Low visibility of transit schedules leads to missed work or school       appointments”).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Present five itemized problems:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Absence       of real-time tracking causes extended waiting times and commute       uncertainty.</li>
  <li>Commuters       lack tools to efficiently plan travel due to unpredictable bus arrival       intervals.</li>
  <li>Operators       cannot dynamically manage fleet scheduling during traffic or route       disruptions.</li>
  <li>Lack       of centralized access to schedule updates limits commuter engagement and feedback.</li>
  <li>Traditional       methods hinder responsiveness to commuter demand and system optimization.</li>
</ol>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>IV.  Objectives of the Study</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  The general objective and specific goals show direct alignment with the problem  set. However, multiple objectives repeat the goal of reducing waiting time.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Group objectives into functional categories and clarify measurable outcomes  (e.g., “Reduce average waiting time by 30%”).<br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong> <br>
  <strong>General  Objective:</strong><br>
  To develop and evaluate a GPS-enabled real-time bus tracking system for Roxas  City that improves commuter experience and operational efficiency.<br>
  <strong>Specific  Objectives:</strong> </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Design       a mobile/web platform to display real-time location and arrival       predictions.</li>
  <li>Integrate       route advisory and travel time estimates for trip planning.</li>
  <li>Provide       digital signage at terminals for visibility of active routes and bus ETA.</li>
  <li>Enable       feedback channels for commuter input and service evaluation.</li>
  <li>Test       system performance across route types, measuring latency, accuracy, and       user satisfaction.</li>
</ol>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>V.  Theoretical Framework</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  The use of Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations, Systems Theory, Task-Technology  Fit, Stakeholder Theory, and HCI is highly appropriate for a transit-focused  ICT initiative.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Avoid overlap between Systems Theory and TTF discussions. Explicitly tie each  theory to a specific system element or stakeholder behavior. Explain why each  theory was selected and how it contributes specifically to the proposed system.<br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong> </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="212" bgcolor="#999999"><strong>Theory</strong> </td>

<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>VI.  Conceptual Framework</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  The conceptual explanation divides the system into hardware, software, and  users, supported by real-time maps and notification tools.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Explain what happens from user action to data flow: e.g., “User opens app →  backend pulls GPS data → ETA calculated →  display map.” <br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Structure the framework like this:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Input:</strong> GPS data, route configuration, bus ID</li>
  <li><strong>Process:</strong> Data aggregation, ETA calculation, alert generation</li>
  <li><strong>Output:</strong> Mobile app visualization, signage updates, operator dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Include  contingency flows (e.g., GPS signal loss or internet downtime).</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>VII.  Operational Definition of Terms</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  Key terms are defined appropriately, including real-time tracking, mobile  application, server, and user feedback.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Provide citations or standards for tech terms. Clarify terms with overlapping  meanings, such as Notification and User Feedback.<br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Format  all definitions consistently and alphabetically to improve readability.</p>
