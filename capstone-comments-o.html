<h1><strong>Comments and Recommendations for Chapter II</strong></h1>
<hr />
<h3 data-start="152" data-end="175">1. Overview Section</h3>
<p data-start="176" data-end="564">The overview is clear and well-structured—it introduces the scope (local and foreign), the purpose (to provide theoretical/practical foundation), and the connection to the proposed system.<br data-start="364" data-end="367">
    <strong data-start="367" data-end="386">Recommendation:</strong> Add citations (e.g., PSA for CBMS, international GIS sources) to ground your statements in credible references. This will also make the section academically stronger. Example:</p>
<blockquote data-start="565" data-end="707">
  <p data-start="567" data-end="707">According to Reyes et al. (2021), community-based information systems provide essential inputs for LGU planning and disaster preparedness.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr data-start="709" data-end="712">
<h3 data-start="714" data-end="749">2. Local Literature and Studies</h3>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1126">The coverage is strong: CBMS, barangay decision-support systems, academic prototypes, and GIS health monitoring.<br data-start="862" data-end="865">
    <strong data-start="865" data-end="884">Recommendation:</strong> Strengthen this section by showing what gaps remain unresolved (e.g., lack of real-time updates, sustainability issues, reliance on outside developers). Right now, these are implied, but you can emphasize them more explicitly. For example:</p>
<blockquote data-start="1127" data-end="1364">
  <p data-start="1129" data-end="1364">While CBMS provides comprehensive data, its periodic nature limits barangay officials’ ability to make timely decisions. Similarly, academic prototypes often fail to sustain operations after pilot testing due to resource constraints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="1366" data-end="1528"><strong data-start="1366" data-end="1385">Recommendation:</strong> Add publication dates where possible. Right now, the timeline is vague—are these recent or older studies? Dates will help establish relevance.</p>
<hr data-start="1530" data-end="1533">
<h3 data-start="1535" data-end="1572">3. Foreign Literature and Studies</h3>
<p data-start="1573" data-end="1894">This section is currently missing. The overview says you will include foreign literature (e.g., open-source mapping, disaster GIS tools), but the actual draft only shows local studies.<br data-start="1757" data-end="1760">
    <strong data-start="1760" data-end="1779">Recommendation:</strong> Add at least three to four foreign references (case studies, projects, or research). Examples you could include:</p>
<ul data-start="1895" data-end="2296">
  <li data-start="1895" data-end="2013">
    <p data-start="1897" data-end="2013">OpenStreetMap (OSM) – widely used for community mapping worldwide, including disaster response in Nepal and Haiti.</p>
  </li>
  <li data-start="2014" data-end="2103">
    <p data-start="2016" data-end="2103">Ushahidi Platform (Kenya) – crowdsourcing and mapping platform for crisis management.</p>
  </li>
  <li data-start="2104" data-end="2199">
    <p data-start="2106" data-end="2199">ArcGIS in Urban Planning – used globally for socio-economic profiling and service delivery.</p>
  </li>
  <li data-start="2200" data-end="2296">
    <p data-start="2202" data-end="2296">QGIS Applications – open-source GIS tools used in developing countries with limited budgets.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p data-start="2298" data-end="2405">Adding these will give your chapter international perspective and highlight best practices you can adapt.</p>
<h3 data-start="3529" data-end="3558">4. Writing Style and Flow</h3>
<p data-start="3559" data-end="3656"><strong data-start="3559" data-end="3578">Recommendation:</strong> Use smoother transitions between local and foreign literature. For example:</p>
<blockquote data-start="3657" data-end="3868">
  <p data-start="3659" data-end="3868">While local systems such as CBMS highlight the importance of standardized profiling, international cases like OpenStreetMap demonstrate how open-source solutions can enhance accessibility and sustainability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-start="3870" data-end="3977"><strong data-start="3870" data-end="3889">Recommendation:</strong> Ensure each study has a conclusion sentence that ties back to your capstone. Example:</p>
<blockquote data-start="3978" data-end="4107">
  <p data-start="3980" data-end="4107">This shows the importance of real-time geotagged household data, which our proposed system will integrate at the purok level.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr data-start="4109" data-end="4112">
<h3 data-start="4114" data-end="4145">5. Citations and References</h3>
<p data-start="4146" data-end="4418">At present, Chapter II has no formal citations.<br data-start="4193" data-end="4196">
    <strong data-start="4196" data-end="4215">Recommendation:</strong> Add APA 7th edition citations for PSA, CBMS manuals, research studies, and foreign platforms (you can use journal articles, government websites, and reputable reports). This will increase credibility.</p>
<h3 data-start="181" data-end="236">6. Visual Support through Screenshots and Figures</h3>
<p data-start="237" data-end="549"><strong data-start="237" data-end="256">Recommendation:</strong> Strengthen your RRL by including screenshots or images of existing systems (e.g., CBMS interface, OpenStreetMap dashboard, barangay mapping prototypes). Visuals make it easier for readers to compare functionalities, see how mapping systems are presented, and understand the user interfaces.</p>
<ul data-start="551" data-end="913">
  <li data-start="551" data-end="680">
    <p data-start="553" data-end="680">For local systems, you can use sample screenshots from CBMS manuals or LGU pilot projects (with proper citation/attribution).</p>
  </li>
  <li data-start="681" data-end="787">
    <p data-start="683" data-end="787">For foreign systems, screenshots from platforms like OpenStreetMap, QGIS, or Ushahidi can be included.</p>
  </li>
  <li data-start="788" data-end="913">
    <p data-start="790" data-end="913">Label each image as a <strong data-start="812" data-end="822">Figure</strong> (e.g., <em data-start="830" data-end="878">Figure 2.1: Sample CBMS Poverty Mapping Output</em>), then refer to it in your text.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p data-start="915" data-end="1122"><strong data-start="915" data-end="927">Benefit:</strong> This will not only improve comprehension but also strengthen your justification that existing systems are either too complex, too resource-dependent, or not sustainable for barangay-level use.</p>
<p data-start="4146" data-end="4418">&nbsp;</p>
<hr data-start="4420" data-end="4423">
<p data-start="4425" data-end="4521"><strong data-start="4425" data-end="4448">Overall Assessment:</strong><br data-start="4448" data-end="4451">
  Your Chapter II already has a strong local foundation, but it needs:</p>
<ol data-start="4522" data-end="4714">
  <li data-start="4522" data-end="4555">
    <p data-start="4525" data-end="4555">Foreign literature inclusion</p>
  </li>
  <li data-start="4556" data-end="4604">
    <p data-start="4559" data-end="4604">Stronger synthesis with a comparative table</p>
  </li>
  <li data-start="4605" data-end="4668">
    <p data-start="4608" data-end="4668">Explicit gap analysis (what is missing in current systems)</p>
  </li>
  <li data-start="4669" data-end="4714">
    <p data-start="4672" data-end="4714">Proper academic citations and references</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p data-start="4716" data-end="4857">This will ensure your RRL clearly justifies why your proposed Household Mapping and Management System for Brgy. Poblacion Sur is necessary.</p>
