<h2>Chapter 2: Literature Review / Technical Background</h2>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provides a synthesis of existing e-learning systems with features like gamification, analytics, and badges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Offers a comparative table that highlights various system components effectively.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Suggestions &amp; Recommendations</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Align with CHED PSG Expectations</strong><br>
      CHED mandates that a BSIT Capstone should integrate the knowledge and skills from the entire curriculum and fall under areas like software development, e-learning systems, multimedia systems, etc. (<a href="https://www.collegesidekick.com/study-docs/14397638?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Module-and-Guidelines-for-IT-Capstone-Project-2.pdf">College Sidekick</a>, <a href="https://stepacademic.net/ijcsr/article/view/318?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Insights and Trends of Capstone Project of CS/IT Department of Bicol ...">stepacademic.net</a>). Ensure that your review explicitly maps concepts to these domains, particularly focusing on e-learning and system development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Structure and Thematic Clarity</strong><br>
      Organize Chapter 2 into clear subsections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Technical Theories &amp; Frameworks (e.g., gamification, learning analytics architecture)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Review of Prior Systems (e.g., MentalUP, ABCmouse, Study Jams)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Standards &amp; Best Practices in E-learning Development</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Identified Gaps (linking literature review with your project’s context)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Depth and Relevance</strong><br>
      For each cited study or system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Clearly summarize key findings or technologies used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Analyze how each informs or differs from your proposed system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Highlight strengths and limitations to justify your design decisions.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Source Credibility &amp; Citation Style</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Ensure all literature is properly cited via academic or peer-reviewed sources, not just generic descriptions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use a consistent citation style (APA, IEEE, or CHED’s preferred format).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Include local or regional sources (e.g., DepEd, academic journals on PH education tech) to strengthen contextual relevance.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Chapter 3: Methodology</h2>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Details Agile methodology phases (Requirement, Design, Development, Testing).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describes procedures like pilot testing, load testing, review, and deployment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Suggestions &amp; Recommendations</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Align with BSIT Capstone Documentation Standards</strong><br>
      CHED/PSITE guidelines emphasize inclusion of methodology in a structured manner — including design, system prototype, deployment, and testing phases as integral parts of the methodology chapter. (<a href="https://capstoneguide.com/capstone-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Capstone Project - Capstone Guide">Capstone Guide</a>, <a href="https://www.collegesidekick.com/study-docs/14397638?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Module-and-Guidelines-for-IT-Capstone-Project-2.pdf">College Sidekick</a>). Make sure these are clearly delineated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Include Key Subsections</strong><br>
      Organize Chapter 3 into the following components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Research Design</strong>: Agile + Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), justification of approach.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Software Architecture &amp; Technical Stack</strong>: Tools and frameworks (e.g., Flutter, Firebase).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Development Procedure</strong>: Sprint cycles, milestones, user stories, MoSCoW prioritization.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Testing Strategy</strong>: Unit, functional, load testing; testing tools used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Deployment Plan</strong>: Pilot rollout, user training, installation procedures.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Evaluation &amp; Feedback</strong>: How will system performance and user satisfaction be assessed?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technical Specificity</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Provide details on technical artifacts: data models, system interfaces, user interaction flows.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If applicable, include pseudocode or architectural diagrams that align with technical review requirements.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Incorporate Project Management Elements</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Include timeline or Gantt chart showing timeline of deliverables across the two semesters.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mention collaboration tools and version control (e.g., Git, Jira, Trello) aligned with Agile practice.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consistency &amp; Clarity</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Ensure your methodology speaks to CHED’s expectations for capstone: feasibility, innovation, professional standard. (<a href="https://capstoneguide.com/capstone-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="Capstone Project - Capstone Guide">Capstone Guide</a>, <a href="https://stjohnpaulcollegeict.weebly.com/uploads/5/6/3/5/56356733/capstone_guidelines_%281%29.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" title="ST. JOHN PAUL II COLLEGE OF DAVAO">stjohnpaulcollegeict.weebly.com</a>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use clear headings, succinct descriptions, and ensure alignment with project objectives from Chapter 1.</p>
      </li>
