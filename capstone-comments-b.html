</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Specify intended functionality: What types of science       content will be gamified? Will assessments be formative, summative, or       both?</li>
  <li>Consider including a design philosophy - e.g.,       learner-centered, modular, adaptive - to define pedagogical intentions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Address technological equity by explaining whether the app supports offline  usage or low-bandwidth conditions, especially in rural settings.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The general objective should be revised to explicitly       indicate subject area (Science) and technological scope (interactive       e-learning system).</li>
  <li>Specific objectives can be grouped by theme (content       delivery, learner engagement, analytics, teacher facilitation) for       improved structure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Define outcome measures linked to each objective. For example:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>“To increase average quiz scores by 15% following       implementation of interactive science games.”</li>

  <li>Attempts to compare traditional and digital engagement       levels using quantitative references.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The section includes incomplete statements (“In ,…”).       Ensure all citations are complete and properly formatted.</li>
  <li>Explicitly reference foundational theories (e.g., Vygotsky’s       Social Constructivism, Deci &amp; Ryan’s Self-Determination Theory) and       explain how they underpin system features.</li>
  <li>The inclusion of classroom statistics (questions asked       per hour) is valuable, but its source and methodology need clarification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Explain how theoretical concepts translate into practical system components  (e.g., gamification encourages autonomy and mastery per SDT).</p>
