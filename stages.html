				<h2>Thesis and Capstone Stages</h2>
					<hr>
					<p align="left">Students  enrolled in Thesis I, Thesis II, Special Project I or Special Project II are  expected to observe the following stages to comply the requirements of the  subjects.<br>
					  Each  Thesis or Special Project group should have three (3) members and a maximum of  four (4) members designated by the Thesis Teacher. Each group should have a  thesis adviser and a document editor other than the Thesis Teacher.<br>
					  Student groupings are encouraged to be of the same  discipline, however if the students wish to combine with different discipline  like Information Technology and Computer Science, they are allowed to provided  they need to propose study on Computer Science areas.<br>
					  The  entire Thesis or Special Project program starts with the thesis proposal  presentation and ends with the submission of an approved thesis hardbound and  other deliverables. The four stages are discussed below:</p>
					<h3 align="left"><strong>A.  Proposal Paper (CS Thesis Writing 1 or Capstone Project and Research 1)</strong></h3>
					<div align="left">
					  <ol>
					    <li>Each  thesis group will start with the identification of a thesis project which  include the following activities:</li>
					    <ol>
					      <li>Identification of the proposed  problem;</li>
					      <li>Specification of the research  objectives;</li>
					      <li>Search of related literature; and</li>
					      <li>Identification of appropriate  methodology to be used in the proposed study.</li>
				        </ol>
					    <li>The  proposal should be in line with the track they previously enrolled in their ITE  subjects.</li>
					    <li>They  are allowed to choose between client-based system development or an innovative  study.</li>
					    <li>Each  group is required to submit their proposal document (Chapter I-III) before they  can be scheduled for proposal evaluation.</li>
					    <li>The  proposal evaluation/defense is done before the panel consisting of a chairman  and two members. A proposal may be approved, approved with revision or  disapproved. Disapproval of the proposal may be based on the following grounds:</li>
					    <ol>
					      <li>Limited  scope of proposal (LS)</li>
					      <li>Proposed  work is not exhaustive (NE)</li>
					      <li>Inadequate  understanding of the proposal (IU)</li>
					      <li>None  conformance of thesis proposal with the college prescribed Thesis Form and  Style (NC)</li>
				        </ol>
					    <li>Criteria  for evaluating the thesis or capstone proposal are specified in the Thesis or  Capstone Evaluation Form. (Appendix F)</li>
					    <li>Only  approved proposals are subjected for succeeding evaluation.</li>
				      </ol>
				  </div>
					<h3 align="left"><strong>B.  Midterm Evaluation (CS Thesis Writing  2 or Capstone  Project and Research 2)</strong></h3>
					<div align="left">
					  <ol>
					    <li>Each  group is required to have a thesis adviser who will monitor their system and  will sign endorsement letter prior to the schedule of the midterm evaluation.</li>
					    <li>Each  group is required to submit a complete midterm thesis or capstone document  which includes the following:</li>
					    <ol>
					      <li>Chapters  I-IV and appendices;</li>
					      <li>developed  program with at least 50% running logic; and</li>
					      <li>endorsement  letter signed by their thesis adviser and the dean. (Appendix G)</li>
				        </ol>
				      </ol>
				  </div>
					<p align="left">These  requirements should be submitted to the Thesis Teacher for evaluation at least  one week before the scheduled midterm panel evaluation otherwise, a group will  not be recommended to join the midterm panel evaluation.</p>
					<div align="left">
					  <ol>
					    <li>Criteria  for evaluating thesis or capstone work are specified in the Thesis or Capstone  Evaluation Form. (Appendix F)</li>
					    <li>Any  group who failed in the midterm evaluation will be given a chance to present  their revised work to the panel for re-evaluation provided they comply with the  requirements as agreed during the midterm evaluation. The date of the  re-evaluation should be set by the Thesis Teacher. If in the re-evaluation, a  group still obtained a failing grade, they will be given a grade of 5.0 in  Thesis I or in Special Project I.</li>
					    <li>Failure  to comply with all the requirements for Thesis I or Special Project I prohibits  the group to enrol in Thesis II.</li>
				      </ol>
				  </div>
					<h3 align="left"><strong>C.  Final Evaluation</strong></h3>

The date of the  re-evaluation should be set by the Thesis Teacher. If in the re-evaluation, a  group still obtained a failing grade, they will be given a grade of 5.0 in  Thesis II or in Special Project II.</li>
					    <li>Groups  who obtained passing grades in the final evaluation will be given an INC  (incomplete) grade until a final thesis or capstone document, thesis or  capstone program, and other deliverables are approved by the panel and accepted  by the college.</li>
