<p><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong> <strong> (Revised)</strong><br>
Despite growing demand for operational  efficiency in fitness centers, Urban Fitness Gym Roxas City branch continues to  utilize manual systems for member management, subscription validation, payment  processing, and product sales. This legacy approach presents several critical  challenges:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The current check-in and attendance system is       inefficient, often resulting in long queues and delayed verification       during peak hours, which negatively affects the member experience.</li>
  <li>The lack of a secure, automated access control system       introduces risks of unauthorized entry and inconsistent enforcement of       subscription-based privileges, compromising both operational integrity and       member safety.</li>
  <li>Manual tracking of payments and subscription renewals       leads to delays, errors, and incomplete records. This creates       administrative burdens and undermines financial accuracy and customer       trust.</li>
  <li>The absence of a structured inventory system for gym       products - such as apparel, supplements, and accessories - results in stock       inconsistencies, missed sales opportunities, and poor resource management.</li>
  <li>Without an integrated data management system, the gym       lacks real-time insights into member attendance, facility usage, and       purchasing behavior, restricting its ability to make informed decisions on       scheduling, marketing, and service enhancements.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>General  Objective (Revised)</strong><br>
To design and implement an  RFID-based management system that enhances operational efficiency, security,  and customer experience at Urban Fitness Gym Roxas City branch by automating  member tracking, subscription validation, payment processing, and product  inventory management.</p>
