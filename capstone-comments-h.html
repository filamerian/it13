<h2>ONLINE COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SYSTEM  FOR FCU HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS</h2>
<hr>
<h3>CHAPTER I - INTRODUCTION </h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>I.  Overview of the Current State of Technology</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  This section effectively outlines global and local trends in  technology-enhanced counseling. It refers to AI, teletherapy, data systems, and  ethical concerns. Institutional context is well-established, including FCU’s  current setup and evaluation efforts.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Include statistics on rising mental health cases among       Filipino students for contextual urgency.</li>
  <li>Discuss challenges in digital counseling adoption in       school environments, including stigma and lack of training.</li>
  <li>Clarify how FCU’s current evaluation efforts relate to       system improvement—e.g., does GSSR data inform counseling goals?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Enrich the section with comparative insights from other private high schools or  DepEd initiatives using digital guidance systems. A short table comparing  traditional vs. digital counseling modes (efficiency, accessibility,  engagement) would aid clarity.</p>

<p><strong>II.  Desired State of Technology</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  Describes a robust web-based system offering multiple features: individual and  group counseling, anonymity, scheduling, real-time support, data security, and  accessibility. User-centered design is emphasized.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Organize features under functional modules (e.g.,       Communication Tools, Privacy Protocols, Session Management).</li>
  <li>Specify if the system will use existing platforms       (e.g., Firebase, WebRTC) or custom-built tools.</li>
  <li>Clarify the authentication strategy—how anonymity       balances with data protection and school accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Visualize key functions using a user flow diagram from login → selection of  service type → counselor interaction → data capture → feedback. Include  accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG compliance) and device compatibility  metrics.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>III.  Statement of the Problem</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  Captures emotional and psychological barriers such as fear of judgment,  shyness, lack of peer connection, and absence of anonymity.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Convert into formal, itemized statements to align with academic conventions.  Reference psychological concepts such as social avoidance, stigma, and  self-concealment to strengthen the rationale.<br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Structure the problems as:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Students experience hesitance in seeking counseling due       to shyness and fear of stigma.</li>
  <li>Lack of anonymity discourages open communication about       sensitive issues.</li>
  <li>Absence of shared spaces limits peer support and social       validation.</li>
  <li>Fear of being judged prevents students from accessing       mental health services.</li>
  <li>Counseling referrals and recordkeeping lack centralized       coordination, leading to delays and missed follow-ups.</li>
</ol>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>IV.  Objectives of the Study</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  The general objective and specific goals align with the problem set and emphasize  communication, confidentiality, accessibility, and monitoring.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Refine wording for clarity and group objectives thematically (Technical,  Operational, Strategic). Incorporate measurable outcomes (e.g., usage rates,  user satisfaction, appointment attendance).<br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong> <br>
  <strong>General Objective:</strong><br>
  To design and develop a secure, user-centered online counseling platform for  FCU High School that facilitates real-time support, peer interaction, and  efficient session management while ensuring privacy and accessibility.<br>
  <strong>Specific Objectives:</strong> </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Implement synchronous and asynchronous communication       tools including chat, video calls, and feedback features.</li>
  <li>Provide anonymous group discussion spaces categorized       by mental health, academic stress, or marginalized identities.</li>
  <li>Enforce data privacy and security protocols compliant       with Philippine laws (e.g., Data Privacy Act of 2012).</li>
  <li>Create a streamlined referral system linking advisers       to counselors with tracking capabilities.</li>
  <li>Build session history logs and analytic tools to       monitor student engagement and outcomes.</li>
</ol>

  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>V.  Theoretical Framework</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  Applies <strong>Social Support Theory</strong> effectively, showing how emotional  validation and shared experiences promote well-being. The connection to digital  communities is logical and relevant.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Explain how theory influences system design—e.g., anonymous chat for belonging,  structured feedback for emotional validation. Reference primary theorists  (e.g., Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985) for academic depth.<br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Map each support type (emotional, informational, belongingness) to system  features. Example:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#999999"><strong>Social     Support Type</strong> </td>
    <td bgcolor="#999999"><p align="left"><strong>Corresponding     System Feature</strong></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Emotional Support</p></td>
    <td><p>Anonymous chat, counselor video    sessions</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
    <td><p>Informational Support</p></td>
    <td><p>Resource library, referral pathways</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Belongingness</p></td>
    <td><p>Peer group discussion spaces</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
    <td><p>Practical Assistance</p></td>
    <td><p>Scheduling tools and progress    tracking</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>VI.  Conceptual Framework</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  Describes stakeholders and system functionality generally. The diagram, titled  “Commuhelp,” seems to capture platform flow but isn’t sufficiently explained.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Detail how system modules interact: student → counselor → feedback → storage.  Distinguish real-time vs. asynchronous components and identify system layers  (user interface, data, security).<br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
  Reconstruct the framework as a process cycle:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Input: student login, service selection, issue       categorization</li>
  <li>Process: secure communication, session logging,       referral tracking</li>
  <li>Output: counselor reports, student feedback, engagement       analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>Describe failure pathways (e.g.,  missed appointment) and how the system addresses them.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>VII.  Operational Definition of Terms</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong><br>
  Definitions are concise and relevant. Covers anonymity, privacy, community  grouping, centralized communication.<br>
  <strong>Suggestions:</strong><br>
  Use a formal glossary table and cite technical sources (e.g., NIST, data  privacy laws).<br>
  <strong>Recommendations:</strong> </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#999999"><strong>Term</strong> </td>
