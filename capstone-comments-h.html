<p><strong>Overall Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chapter II</strong> needs <strong>more scholarly and local sources</strong>, better <strong>comparative analysis</strong>, and <strong>gap justification</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chapter III</strong> needs <strong>clearer methodology structure</strong>, <strong>visual diagrams</strong>, <strong>testing details</strong>, and <strong>ethical compliance documentation</strong>.</p>
