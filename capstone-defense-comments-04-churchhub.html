  <h2> Summary</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="images/capstone-defense-04.png" width="200" height="200" align="right">The ChurchHub project addresses the need for a centralized system to manage church operations such as membership, events, announcements, and financial records. The proposal is well-written and organized. It demonstrates a clear understanding of local needs and offers a practical solution. Strengths include strong context, use of Task-Technology Fit and IPO frameworks, and comprehensive related literature. Weaknesses include objectives written as modules, limited technical details on security and financial transparency, and lack of database schema or evaluation instrument details.  </p>
