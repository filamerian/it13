  <h2> Summary</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="images/capstone-defense-06.png" width="200" height="200" align="right">ASSISTA addresses an important local problem: slow, paper-based processing of AICS applications that creates delays, fragmented records, and poor communication with beneficiaries. The proposal is relevant and well-structured. Strengths include a clear problem overview, a practical set of modules (registration, tracking, notification, reporting, awareness), and the use of Agile (Scrum). Areas to improve are clearer objectives (make them outcome-focused), more detail in methodology (sprint plan, sample sizes), technical design details (ERD, security, backup), and a stronger evaluation plan tied to standards and targets.  </p>

      <ol>
        <li>To develop a digital registration and submission process that reduces errors, shortens queues, and improves accessibility for applicants, especially in remote barangays.</li>
        <li>To provide a real-time application tracking feature that enables administrators to monitor submission progress and improves transparency in the evaluation of assistance requests.</li>
        <li>To establish an integrated communication and notification system that keeps applicants informed of updates, follow-ups, and status changes, improving engagement and reducing missed information.</li>
        <li>To automate report generation for the CSWDO, ensuring timely compilation of assistance data that supports program monitoring, impact evaluation, and policy decision-making.</li>
        <li>To promote awareness and accessibility of the AICS program in Roxas City by integrating digital tools that improve tracking of applications and strengthen engagement with beneficiaries.</li>

This will give your study a stronger academic foundation.</td>

Still, it can be improved by being more specific about what is included, such as registration, tracking, notifications, reporting, and awareness features. At the same time, clearly state what is excluded, like other social aid programs (e.g., 4Ps or disaster relief) or features that go beyond the project’s timeline. Also, mention practical limitations such as the need for internet access, availability of computers or mobile devices, and that the project is limited to a web-based prototype. This will make your scope realistic and help set the right expectations.</td>

  <h3>Chapter III - Methodology</h3>
  <p data-start="240" data-end="542">Your methodology chapter is well-written and clearly explains why Agile (Scrum) was chosen. The structure flows logically from requirement analysis to deployment and maintenance, and you identified the tools and technologies correctly. It shows that you understand the process of developing a system.</p>
  <p data-start="544" data-end="639">However, several parts need improvement to make the methodology stronger and more consistent:</p>
  <ol data-start="641" data-end="2620">
    <li data-start="641" data-end="866">
      <p data-start="644" data-end="866"><strong data-start="644" data-end="669">Agile (Scrum) Details</strong>: You explained Scrum well, but you did not specify sprint length (for example, 2 weeks) and expected deliverables per sprint. This detail will make your plan more realistic and easier to follow.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="868" data-end="1104">
      <p data-start="871" data-end="1104"><strong data-start="871" data-end="887">Design Phase</strong>: You mentioned Figma, UML diagrams, and database schema, but the ERD and schema are not shown in this section. Add at least one ERD and a sample database design to prove the data structure supports your objectives.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="1106" data-end="1388">
      <p data-start="1109" data-end="1388"><strong data-start="1109" data-end="1130">Development Phase</strong>: You listed the technologies (React, Laravel, MySQL), which is good. To improve, briefly explain why these tools were chosen (for example, Laravel for security, React for modular UI, MySQL for scalability). This shows you did not just pick tools randomly.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="1390" data-end="1734">
      <p data-start="1393" data-end="1734"><strong data-start="1393" data-end="1421">Testing and Verification</strong>: The testing part is strong because you included UAT with CSWDO staff. Still, it will be better if you add clear acceptance targets (for example, &quot;System should achieve 95 percent accuracy in test cases&quot; or &quot;average usability rating of 4 out of 5&quot;).</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="1736" data-end="1884">
      <p data-start="1739" data-end="1884"><strong data-start="1739" data-end="1759">Deployment Phase</strong>: You explained local deployment well. Strengthen this by adding your plan for data security and backups during deployment.</p>

      <p data-start="1889" data-end="2118"><strong data-start="1889" data-end="1918">Maintenance and Evolution</strong>: This section is good because you listed future upgrades. To improve, clarify which upgrades can be done within the capstone timeline and which ones are only recommendations for future development.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="2120" data-end="2368">
      <p data-start="2123" data-end="2368"><strong data-start="2123" data-end="2151">Scrum Framework Overview</strong>: This is detailed, but avoid repeating what was already said under Agile Methodology. Make this shorter by focusing on how your team used each part (Product Backlog, Sprint Planning, etc.), not just the definition.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-start="2370" data-end="2620">
      <p data-start="2373" data-end="2620"><strong data-start="2373" data-end="2399">Tools and Technologies</strong>: You listed tools clearly. Improve this by creating a simple table that matches each tool with its purpose (for example, “React.js – frontend development”). This makes it easier for readers and panelists to understand.</p>
