<h1>Integrated Service Request and Booking System for Jacah Randa Beach Cabanas</h1>
</strong>

<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
<p><img src="images/jacah_randa_logo.png" width="200" height="200" align="right">Jacah Randa Beach Resort currently relies on manual processes for handling guest service requests, bookings, and inventory tracking. Guests must physically approach the front desk or call staff to request services or make reservations, which often leads to delays, miscommunication, and dissatisfaction. Staff also face challenges in organizing requests, managing resources, and coordinating tasks efficiently especially during peak seasons.</p>
<p>This project proposes the development of an integrated mobile-based system that enables guests to submit service requests and book resort amenities digitally, while allowing staff to manage these requests, bookings, and inventory in real-time. The system will also implement role-based access control to ensure secure and efficient task delegation across departments.</p>
<hr />
<h3> II. Statement of the Problem</h3>
<p><strong>General Problem:</strong><br />
  Jacah Randa Beach Resort lacks a centralized digital system for managing service requests, bookings, and inventory, resulting in operational inefficiencies and diminished guest satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Problems:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Manual Service Requests:</strong> Guests must physically approach the front desk or call staff to request services, causing inconvenience and delays.</li>
  <li><strong>Uncoordinated Staff Response:</strong> Staff struggle to track, prioritize, and fulfill multiple service requests, especially during peak hours.</li>
  <li><strong>Fragmented Booking Process:</strong> Bookings for rooms and amenities are handled separately from service requests, leading to disorganized workflows and increased administrative burden.</li>
  <li><strong>Inefficient Inventory Management:</strong> Inventory is manually tracked, resulting in shortages, overstock, and poor resource allocation.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Role-Based Access Control:</strong> All staff have equal access to system functions, which compromises data security and task segregation.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3> III. Project Objectives</h3>
<p><strong>General Objective:</strong><br />
  To design and develop a mobile-based system that integrates service requests, booking management, inventory tracking, and role-based access control for Jacah Randa Beach Resort.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Objectives:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>To develop a mobile application that allows guests to digitally request services from their rooms</strong>, eliminating the need for physical visits or phone calls.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>To create a staff dashboard that enables real-time tracking, prioritization, and management of service requests</strong>, improving response time and coordination.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>To implement a unified booking system within the app for rooms and amenities</strong>, streamlining reservation processes and reducing administrative overhead.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>To integrate an inventory management module that monitors item availability and usage</strong>, ensuring efficient resource allocation and preventing shortages.    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>To apply role-based access control (RBAC) to segregate staff responsibilities and secure system operations</strong>, enhancing data protection and workflow clarity.    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
