<h2 align="left"><strong>PROPERTY  MANAGEMENT AND INVENTORY SYSTEM FOR LAWAAN INTEGRATED SCHOOL</strong></h2>
<hr>
<h2>CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Strong contextualization of manual inventory challenges in public schools.</li>
  <li>Effective use of comparative tables to highlight inefficiencies.</li>
  <li>Clear alignment with DepEd’s digital transformation goals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Include a brief summary of the school’s asset profile (e.g., number of items, categories) to quantify the scope.</li>
  <li>Consider adding a short anecdote or example of a recent inventory issue to personalize the problem.</li>
  <li>Clarify whether the system will support consumables in future phases.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Desired State of Technology</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clear articulation of system features and user roles.</li>
  <li>Modular design and phased deployment show foresight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add a diagram showing user interaction flow (e.g., teacher → scan → request → admin approval).</li>
  <li>Mention fallback procedures for offline use or QR scanning errors.</li>
  <li>Consider referencing open-source platforms or frameworks to support sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Specific operational pain points are well identified.</li>
  <li>Strong emphasis on accountability and reporting challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reframe some issues into measurable indicators (e.g., “X% of records found inaccurate during last audit”).</li>
  <li>Consider adding a note on the impact of these inefficiencies on instructional time or budgeting.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Objectives of the Study</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Objectives are actionable and aligned with system features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add an objective related to system performance (e.g., accuracy, uptime, user satisfaction).</li>
  <li>Consider including a goal for future scalability or inter-school replication.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Integration of Automation Theory, IST, QR Code Theory, and Systems Theory is well scaffolded.</li>
  <li>Conceptual framework diagrams are clear and relevant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Include citations directly in the diagram captions for academic rigor.</li>
  <li>Consider adding a feedback loop in the lifecycle diagram to show iterative improvement.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Operational Definition of Terms</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Definitions are precise and context-aware.</li>
  <li>Good use of theory to anchor terms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add definitions for “real-time synchronization” and “digital literacy” if referenced in training plans.</li>
  <li>Consider grouping terms by category (e.g., technical, user roles, system outputs) for clarity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Scope and Limitations</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Realistic scope with clear boundaries.</li>
  <li>Acknowledges digital literacy and connectivity constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clarify whether the system supports mobile-first design or responsive web layout.</li>
  <li>Add a note on how QR codes will be maintained (e.g., reprinting, damage handling).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Significance of the Study</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-stakeholder impact is well articulated.</li>
  <li>Strong alignment with DepEd and LGU priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Include a visual stakeholder impact matrix to reinforce clarity.</li>
  <li>Consider adding a paragraph on how this study contributes to academic literature or future research.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER II: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Diverse sources from local and international contexts.</li>
  <li>Synthesis table effectively maps findings to project goals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add a short critique of each system’s limitations and how the proposed system addresses them.</li>
  <li>Consider grouping literature by theme (e.g., QR-based systems, school implementations, asset lifecycle) for better flow.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER III: METHODOLOGY</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Agile methodology is well justified and clearly explained.</li>
  <li>Integration and testing phases are detailed and practical.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Include a Gantt chart or sprint timeline to visualize development phases.</li>
  <li>Add testing metrics (e.g., scan accuracy, report generation time) and thresholds for success.</li>
  <li>Clarify how feedback from pilot users will be collected and used iteratively.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>System Design and Development</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>UI/UX descriptions are clear and student-friendly.</li>
  <li>QR code integration is well explained.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Include wireframes or UI mockups to support design claims.</li>
  <li>Add a module for admin-side content updates (e.g., asset reassignment, depreciation tracking).</li>
  <li>Consider referencing accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) for inclusive design.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Maintenance and Review</h2>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Acknowledges the need for ongoing support and updates.</li>
  <li>Includes security and performance considerations.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>This proposal is well-positioned for capstone success and potential replication across public schools. To strengthen it further:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Continue developing your working protoytype and prepare a short pitch  for panel presentation.</li>
  <li>Include visual scaffolding (e.g., diagrams, mockups, flowcharts).</li>
  <li>Draft a defense script that emphasizes system impact, technical rigor, and alignment with national goals.</li>
</ul>
