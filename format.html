					    LIST OF APPENDICES</p>
						<h2 align="left">CHAPTER </h2>
						<h3 align="left">&nbsp;</h3>
						<h3 align="left">I.         INTRODUCTION</h3>
						<p align="left"><strong>Overview  of the Current State of Technology</strong></p>
						<p align="left">This section gives the reader an overview of the specific  technology or field in the international or local setting. The information  regarding the technology or field should be contemporary and not based on  outdated sources. Discussion must not be too technical or too detailed.</p>
						<p align="left">This section ends with a discussion on the problems faced  by or that still exist in the specific technology or field (e.g., limitations  of existing software or algorithms).</p>
						<p align="left"><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong></p>
						<p align="left">This section clearly articulates the issue or challenge  that your project aims to solve or address. This sets the foundation for your  entire project, guiding your research or development process, and helping  readers understand the significance and context of your work.</p>
						<p align="left">In essence, the Statement of the Problem defines the core  issue you are tackling, explains why it is important, and outlines the scope  and limitations of the problem. It also helps justify why your project is  necessary and what contribution it aims to make to the field of Information  Technology.</p>
						<p align="left">The problem statement would lead to the research  objectives.</p>
						<p align="left"><strong>Objectives of the Study</strong></p>
						<p align="left"><strong>General Objective</strong><br>
						  <br>
						  This  section states the overall goal that must be achieved to answer the problem.</p>
						<p align="left"><strong>Specific Objectives</strong></p>
						<p align="left">This subsection is an elaboration of the general  objective. It states the specific steps that must be undertaken to accomplish  the general objective. These objectives must be <strong><em>specific, measurable, attainable,  realistic, time-bounded</em></strong>. Each specific objective may start with “<strong>to design/survey/review/analyze…</strong>”</p>
						<p align="left">Studying a particular programming language or development  tool (e.g., to study Windows/Object-Oriented/Graphics/C++ programming) to  accomplish the general objective is inherent in all thesis and, therefore, must  not be included here.</p>
						<p align="left">                        <br>
					    <strong>Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks</strong></p>
						<p align="left">This section discusses the theories and concepts to be  used in the course of designing or developing the thesis. Include only those  concepts that you feel will be needed. DO NOT copy the whole source material.  Use the topics stated in the objectives as a guide in determining the contents  of this section.<br>
						  <br>
						  <strong>Theoretical Framework</strong></p>
						<p align="left">A Theoretical Framework refers to the foundational  concepts, theories, and models that inform and guide the research, development,  or implementation process of the project. It provides a structured way to  understand and interpret the problem you're solving, the methodology you're  using, and the expected outcomes of your project. Essentially, it acts as a  lens through which you approach your research or solution, helping to align  your project with existing knowledge and ensuring that your work contributes to  the field.</p>
						<p align="left">The Theoretical Framework usually includes one or more  established theories or models relevant to the field of information technology.  For instance, in IT-related capstone projects, you might draw from:</p>
						<div align="left">
						  <ul>
						    <li>Systems Theory: To understand how different  components of a system (hardware, software, users) interact.</li>
						    <li>Technology Acceptance Model (TAM): For  projects that involve user adoption of new technology.</li>
						    <li>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): If  your project involves software development, you might use SDLC as a guiding  framework.</li>
						    <li>Agile Methodology: For projects that focus on  iterative development and continuous feedback.</li>
						    <li>Information Systems (IS) Theory: This can be  used to explore how information is collected, processed, stored, and  disseminated.</li>
					      </ul>
				  </div>
						<p align="left"><strong>Conceptual Framework</strong></p>
						<p align="left">A Conceptual Framework in an IT Capstone project is a  visual or narrative representation that outlines the key concepts, variables,  and relationships involved in the project. It helps to structure the problem  you're addressing, the methodology you're using, and how you expect the various  elements of your project to interact with each other. While a Theoretical  Framework is grounded in established theories and models, the Conceptual  Framework focuses more on how you translate those ideas into practical,  actionable components relevant to your specific project.</p>
						<p align="left">In simpler terms, the Conceptual Framework is a bridge  between theory and practice - it helps to clarify and organize your approach to  the problem, ensuring you address the right variables and relationships in your  project.</p>
						<p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Operational  Definition of Terms</strong></p>
						<p align="left">Provide  clear and specific definitions for the key concepts, terms, variables, or  constructs that are used throughout the project. These definitions outline how  each term will be measured or observed within the scope of the project,  ensuring clarity and consistency in interpretation. Operational definitions are  essential because they set clear boundaries for the project, reduce ambiguity,  and ensure that anyone reviewing or working on the project has a consistent  understanding of the terms being used.</p>
						<p align="left"><strong>Scope and  Limitation of the Study</strong></p>
						<p align="left">This section discusses the boundaries (with respect to  the objectives) of the research/proposed system and the constraints within  which the research will be developed.</p>
						<p align="left"><strong>Significance  of the Study</strong></p>
						<p align="left">This section explains why research/system must be done in  this area. It rationalizes the objective of the research/system with that of  the stated problem. Avoid including here sentences such as “This research will  be beneficial to the proponents/department/college” as this is already an  inherent requirement thesis/capstone projects. Focus on the research’s  contribution to the field of Information Technology and Computer Studies.</p>
						<h3 align="left">&nbsp;</h3>
						<h3 align="left">II.        REVIEW OF LITERATURE AND STUDIES</h3>
						<p align="left">This section discusses the features, capabilities, and  limitations of existing research, algorithms, or software that are  related/similar to the thesis. The reviewed works and software must be arranged  either in chronological order, or by area (from general to specific). Observe a  consistent format when presenting each of the reviewed works.</p>
						<p align="left">The  Review of Literature typically includes both theoretical background and  empirical studies that inform your research or project design. It's essential  to organize the review clearly to guide the reader through existing knowledge,  set the context for your research, and highlight how your capstone project  contributes to the field.</p>
						<h3 align="left">&nbsp;</h3>
						<h3 align="left">III.        METHODOLOGY</h3>
						<p align="left">This section lists and discusses the specific steps and  activities that will be performed by the proponents to accomplish the project.</p>
						<p align="left">Examples of activities include inquiry, survey, research,  brainstorming, canvassing, consultation, review, interview, observe,  experiment, design, test, document, etc. or as defined by the chosen Software  Development Life Cycle Model. </p>
						<p align="left">The methodology also includes the following information:</p>
						<div align="left">
						  <ul>
						    <li>who is responsible for the task</li>
						    <li>the resource person to be contacted</li>
						    <li>what will be done</li>
						    <li>when and how long will the activity be done</li>
						    <li>where will it be done</li>
						    <li>why should be activity be done</li>
