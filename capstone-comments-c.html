<h3><strong>CHAPTER I – INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
</h3>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>I.  Overview of the Current State of Technology</strong><br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Offers a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of AR,       contextualized within global Industry 4.0 frameworks.</li>
  <li>Effectively distinguishes AR from VR, emphasizing AR's       layered interaction with the real environment.</li>
  <li>Integrates theoretical foundations such as digital       twins, cloud connectivity, and sensor-based feedback, which elevate       technical depth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>While international examples like Google ARCore are       strong, inclusion of local AR use cases (e.g., DepEd Digital Rise,       Philippine startup deployments) would enhance contextual relevance.</li>
  <li>Some descriptions drift toward promotional tone (e.g.,       “AR continues to push technological boundaries…”); revise these to       maintain scholarly objectivity.</li>
  <li>The transition to campus-specific navigation use could       be smoother - consider ending this section with a lead-in to local       navigation challenges or needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Incorporate educational AR implementations in Philippine institutions to create  a tighter bridge to the proposed system.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>II.  Desired State of Technology</strong><br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Clearly defines the intended application of AR for       campus navigation, specifying functional components like scanning areas,       POI features, and directional guidance.</li>
  <li>Establishes the proposal’s relevance for enhancing       accessibility and operational efficiency on campus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The section repeats terms (e.g., “Application-based       application”), which could be streamlined for clarity.</li>
  <li>“Scanning area” and “navigation-based feature” need       clearer explanation or technical references - are these QR codes,       geo-markers, or visual triggers?</li>
  <li>The discussion of implementation steps (infrastructure,       user training) is forward-thinking and useful, but might be better placed       in Chapter III – Methodology.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Add illustrations or flow diagrams showing how scanning, navigation, and POI  interaction happen from the user’s perspective.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>III.  Statement of the Problem</strong><br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Identifies five clear operational and accessibility       challenges faced by campus users.</li>
  <li>Emphasizes gaps in user experience, assistance demands,       and inclusivity for those with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Present the statement as interrogative research       questions to guide instrument development. For example: </li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>How does the AR Navigation System affect navigational        efficiency for campus visitors?</li>
    <li>What accessibility improvements does it offer to users        with mobility or cognitive challenges?</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Add a short transition paragraph that links these challenges to the need for a  technological intervention grounded in AR.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>IV.  Objectives of the Study</strong><br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The general objective highlights both functional       (navigation) and experiential (interaction) goals.</li>
  <li>Specific objectives cover system design, accessibility,       performance evaluation, and POI content delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Revise objective #2 for clarity. “Scanning area       interface” can be confusing - consider: “To design interface components       enabling users to initiate AR experiences through designated scanning       zones.”</li>
  <li>Specify measurable criteria for objective #4: e.g.,       navigation accuracy thresholds, time-to-destination benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Include objectives related to user satisfaction or engagement to support  qualitative evaluation.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>V.  Theoretical Framework</strong><br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Cites the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model, a credible       and appropriate theory for matching AR tools to user needs.</li>
  <li>Highlights performance impact through descriptive       outcomes, such as efficiency and satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The theory section blends analysis with implementation       benefits - recommend separating conceptual insights from application       narratives.</li>
  <li>Include additional frameworks like the Technology       Acceptance Model (TAM) or Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of       Technology (UTAUT) for a broader theoretical lens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Explain how TTF informs both system design choices and post-adoption evaluation  methods.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>VI.  Conceptual Framework</strong><br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Identifies key system components and user roles,       including login modules, directional arrows, POIs, and backend       cloud/database support.</li>
  <li>Presents a clear, modular breakdown of system       architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Replace branding mentions (e.g., MultiSet AI) with       general terms or indicate it’s a proposed tool unless formally endorsed.</li>
  <li>Clarify how users transition from scanning area to       navigation interface and POI information - diagram this sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Insert flowcharts or swimlane diagrams to illustrate system interactions from  user login to navigation and destination arrival.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>VII.  Operational Definition of Terms</strong><br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Defines key constructs such as Augmented Reality,       Guide, Application-Based App, and Information System clearly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Avoid redundancy; &quot;Application-based       application&quot; can be simplified to &quot;Web-based platform&quot; or       &quot;App-based system.&quot;</li>
  <li>Add sources to definitions (e.g., from IEEE, ACM, or       government ICT glossaries).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Include terms like “Digital Twin,” “AR Marker,” and “POI Feature” to match  framework terminology.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>VIII.  Scope and Limitations</strong><br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Clearly establishes the physical scope (Filamer       Christian University campus) and functionality boundaries (navigation and       facility info only).</li>
  <li>Acknowledges platform compatibility concerns, excluding       broader AR applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Bullet-point or tabular presentation would improve       clarity.</li>
  <li>Expand on time scope (pilot duration, academic year),       user roles (students, visitors), and hardware assumptions (iOS vs. Android       support).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Discuss potential scalability concerns, including server load and expansion to  other campuses or multi-floor facilities.</p>
<div align="center">
  <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
</div>
<p><strong>IX.  Significance of the Study</strong><br>

  <li>Articulates specific benefits like stress reduction,       onboarding support, and data-informed improvement planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Formalize tone and avoid subjective language such as       “reducing stress” or “helping them settle in” - use “streamlining       orientation” or “enhancing user onboarding.”</li>
  <li>Expand future researcher section to discuss potential       extensions like IoT and multi-campus integration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommended Enhancement:</strong><br>
  Include references to institutional strategic goals (e.g., smart campus  initiatives or accreditation criteria linked to innovation).</p>

<h2> Comments on Chapter 2</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The chapter presents a solid foundation of AR, campus navigation systems, and mobile technology.</li>
  <li>Literature sources appear relevant, although some dated citations may weaken its academic currency.</li>
  <li>Local and foreign studies are presented, but there’s limited synthesis or comparative critique.</li>
  <li>Definitions of key concepts are given, but integration with the proposed system could be stronger.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Structural &amp; Thematic Suggestions</h3>
<h3>1. <strong>Conceptual Framework Integration</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure a clear articulation of how theories like Task-Technology Fit (TTF) link with system functions.</li>
  <li>Visual aids (e.g., conceptual maps or diagrammatic overlays) can clarify alignment between theory and implementation.</li>
  <li>Consider structuring the literature to mirror system modules (e.g., navigation logic, AR immersion, user feedback), making it easier to justify design choices later in Chapter 3.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Literature Critique Depth</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Move beyond descriptive summaries. Highlight gaps, conflicting findings, or methodological flaws in past studies.</li>
  <li>Identify at least one unresolved issue that your system attempts to solve, strengthening justification.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Currency and Relevance</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Replace or supplement older studies (pre-2018) with more current research on AR in education, especially campus-based use cases.</li>
  <li>Cite platform-specific references (e.g., Unity, ARCore) that influence your system’s implementation strategy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Detailed Recommendations by Section</h3>
<h3>A. <strong>Review of Related Literature</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Organize by Theme</strong>: Instead of listing sources sequentially, cluster them by conceptual relevance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AR in Education</li>
      <li>AR Navigation Models</li>
      <li>Accessibility and Inclusive Tech</li>
      <li>Mobile UI/UX for Navigation</li>
      <li>System Usability and Feedback Mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Embed Analytical Commentary</strong>: After each thematic group, summarize the key insights and explain how they inform system design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Incorporate Emerging Trends</strong>: Include studies on AI-assisted navigation, user interaction with AR overlays, and behavioral feedback loops.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>B. <strong>Review of Related Studies</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Compare and Contrast</strong>: Present at least one tabular comparison of 2–3 similar systems (local and foreign), showing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Objectives</li>
      <li>Technologies Used</li>
      <li>Strengths</li>
      <li>Limitations</li>
      <li>Relevance to Current Study</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gap Identification</strong>: Explicitly state the void your system fills (e.g., “none addressed context-aware POI feedback on mobile AR for campus use”).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>C. <strong>Synthesis Section</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Include a clear narrative of how the literature guided your system:
    <ul>
        <li>“Based on the emphasis on user-centered AR models, our system adopts POI-based overlays…”</li>
      <li>“Studies advocating agile adaptation informed our iterative testing protocol…”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>General Comments on Chapter 3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The chapter outlines key procedural steps and mentions the use of Agile methodology and Task-Technology Fit (TTF) as theoretical anchors.</li>
  <li>The development process is described chronologically, which supports instructional clarity.</li>
  <li>However, deeper articulation of stakeholder roles, validation strategies, and system testing protocols would strengthen the structure and academic depth.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>1. <strong>Methodological Cohesion</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reaffirm the logical link between the <strong>TTF model</strong> and the choice of <strong>Agile methodology</strong>. A brief explanation of how these models complement each other would clarify the rationale behind iterative development based on user tasks.</li>
  <li>Introduce a process flow diagram or annotated timeline to visualize the entire lifecycle from planning to deployment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Stakeholder-Centered Process Design</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identify primary and secondary stakeholders in each development phase: users, testers, campus administrators, etc.</li>
  <li>Explain how stakeholder feedback loops are built into sprints (e.g., feedback after prototype testing, routing decisions informed by user walkthroughs).</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>System Environment and Tools</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>List and justify development tools/platforms used:
    <ul>
        <li>Unity3D, ARCore for AR implementation</li>
      <li>Firebase or other cloud solutions for data management</li>
      <li>Cross-platform testing (Android/iOS) if relevant</li>
      <li>Include diagrams or snippets to show integration points if applicable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>A. <strong>Research Design / Development Method</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>If Agile is central, describe sprint frequency, task breakdown, role assignments, and evaluation checkpoints.</li>
  <li>Include at least one matrix mapping <em>tasks ↔ features ↔ stakeholder feedback</em>, which aids in showing how theory applies in practice.</li>
</ul>
<h3>B. <strong>System Architecture &amp; Design</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Discuss modularity explicitly: What components are decoupled? How does that support scalability and maintenance?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider including layered diagrams:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Presentation Layer (UI/AR interface)</li>
      <li>Logic Layer (navigation engine, marker recognition)</li>
      <li>Data Layer (user records, POI content, analytics logs)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each component, specify:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Input/output data types</li>
      <li>How it interacts with other modules</li>
      <li>How updates propagate across the system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>C. <strong>Implementation Plan</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Break into phases:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Requirements Gathering</li>
      <li>Prototyping</li>
      <li>Testing and Evaluation</li>
      <li>Deployment</li>
      <li>Maintenance</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each phase, detail:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Objectives</li>
      <li>Techniques used (e.g., user interviews, usability testing)</li>
      <li>Outcomes expected or achieved</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>D. <strong>Testing Procedures</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Outline specific tests:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unit testing (individual components)</li>
      <li>Integration testing (cross-module functionality)</li>
      <li>Usability testing (user feedback on navigation flow)</li>
      <li>Accessibility testing (contrast ratios, screen reader compatibility)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide sample test cases or scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“If a user scans an incorrect marker, the app should return a fallback prompt.”</li>
      <li>“If AR arrows are misaligned, a report option appears for calibration assistance.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Suggested Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Include mock-up screens or wireframes that align with described modules.</li>
  <li>Connect the methodology chapter to Chapter 2 by referencing specific technologies or principles justified in the literature.</li>
  <li>Use clear transitions between planning, design, and testing subtopics to help readers follow the development flow.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
