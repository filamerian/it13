<h2><strong>REVISED  Statement of the Problem</strong></h2>
<p>	Efficient navigation within a university campus is essential for creating a positive experience for students, visitors, and staff. At Filamer Christian University, existing navigation methods such as printed maps, static signage, and verbal directions often result in delays, confusion, and reliance on human assistance. The absence of a modern, technology-driven solution limits the university’s ability to provide fast, accurate, and accessible wayfinding. An Augmented Reality (AR)-based navigation system has the potential to address these gaps by offering interactive, real-time guidance and location-specific information. However, no such system is currently in place, and its impact on navigation efficiency, accessibility, and user experience has yet to be determined.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Visitors have difficulty locating specific facilities or offices due to the absence of a real-time, Augmented Reality (AR)-assisted navigation system that provides step-by-step guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Students with disabilities or special needs face challenges in navigating the campus efficiently and independently because no AR-based navigation tool is currently available to address accessibility requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Campus staff are frequently burdened with providing manual directions, as there is no digital navigation solution to enable visitors to find their destinations without assistance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The university lacks a modern and interactive navigation system, resulting in a less engaging campus experience compared to what AR technology can provide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users often encounter difficulty obtaining accurate and detailed information about the functions and services of specific offices or facilities, as existing resources do not deliver dynamic, location-aware content.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
