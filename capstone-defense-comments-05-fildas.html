<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
<img src="images/capstone-defense-05.png" width="200" height="200" align="right">The FilDAS project proposes a digital archiving and management system to solve inefficiencies in the QA office's document handling. The proposal is strong in identifying the problem and offering a system tailored to QA operations. The objectives, however, are written mostly as modules and should be rewritten to show outcomes and improvements. The methodology is appropriate, using Agile, but lacks details such as sprint length, evaluation standards, and database design. The review of literature is comprehensive but needs better synthesis and connection to the project's unique contributions.</p>

  <li>Allow list view in folders</li>
  <li>Include clear labels and tooltips for buttons and functions to guide new users. </li>
  <li>Add advanced search options such as keyword, date, author, or document type filters.</li>
  <li>Ensure proper version control so users can track document updates and revisions.</li>
  <li>If possible, include a preview feature for documents before downloading to save time.</li>
  <li>Incorporate a proper upload validation to prevent incorrect file types or corrupted files.</li>
  <li>Revise sections of the project that appear AI-generated or generic. Ensure that the content, descriptions, and examples reflect your own original work and understanding of the system.</li>
