<h2>E-GUIDANCE CONNECT: ANONYMITY BULLYING REPORT SYSTEMS FOR FCU GUIDANCE OFFICE</h2>
<hr>
<h3><strong>CHAPTER  I - INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>1.  Overview of the Current State of Technology</strong><br>
<strong>Comments:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Strong foundational context is presented, highlighting       how technology - especially anonymity-based platforms - serves as a response       to bullying challenges.</li>
  <li>Mentions AI and data technologies, anchoring the       system’s potential in modern computing, but the link between these       technologies and the proposed solution remains general.</li>
  <li>Historical grounding with FCU’s counseling services       adds institutional relevance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Clarify how artificial intelligence and data analytics       will specifically be used in the system (e.g., prioritizing reports,       analyzing patterns).</li>
  <li>Strengthen coherence by removing vague phrases like       “history of guidance…” mid-paragraph and aligning it with the system’s       evolution.</li>
  <li>Mention limitations in current manual systems and how       these motivated the project vision.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>

<p><strong>3.  Statement of the Problem</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Articulates pain points well: lack of anonymity, social       stigma, inefficiency of manual systems, and the need for real-time       support.</li>
  <li>Balances emotional concerns with procedural gaps in       FCU’s current approach.</li>
  <li>Mixes narrative and enumerated list; formatting can be       improved for readability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Rephrase problem items into formal academic style using       consequence framing (e.g., &quot;The absence of an anonymous system       results in...&quot;).</li>
  <li>Include reference to specific data or incidents if       available, to strengthen urgency.</li>
  <li>Use parallel structure in listing issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations / Revised Statement of the Problem:</strong></p>
<p>Bullying continues to be a pervasive  issue in educational institutions, manifesting in both physical and digital  environments. At Filamer Christian University (FCU) High School, recent trends  have shown fluctuations in reported cases, with a noted decline following  manual interventions by the Guidance Office. However, this decrease does not  necessarily reflect full resolution—many cases remain unreported due to fear of  retaliation, stigma, and a lack of safe, accessible mechanisms for disclosure.<br>
The current reporting protocol at  FCU heavily relies on manual documentation, which presents several limitations  in terms of confidentiality, responsiveness, and data handling. Students are  often required to verbally report or fill out written forms, processes that  inherently compromise anonymity and deter victims or witnesses from seeking  help. Furthermore, the system lacks real-time analytics and integration with counselor  workflows, making early interventions slow and data-driven decision-making  nearly impossible.<br>
To ensure a safer, student-centered  reporting environment, the following key issues must be addressed:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><strong>Absence of an Anonymous Digital Channel:</strong> The lack of a secure and anonymized reporting platform       discourages students from disclosing incidents of bullying, particularly       those that are emotionally or socially sensitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited Emotional Support and Follow-Up Mechanisms:</strong> Without dedicated support pathways following a report,       victims may experience prolonged psychological distress or uncertainty       about case outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Inefficiency in Addressing Cyberbullying Cases:</strong> The manual system is not equipped to respond to online       bullying, leaving digital harassment underreported and unresolved.</li>
  <li><strong>Fear of Social Judgment and Reprisal:</strong> Students often refrain from reporting due to concerns       about peer labeling, administrative bias, or future targeting by       aggressors.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Integrated Response Framework:</strong> The absence of a centralized digital system inhibits       data consolidation, timely notifications, and pattern recognition needed       for effective preventive action.</li>
</ol>
<p>The need for an anonymous, secure,  and responsive reporting tool is therefore critical—not only for capturing  accurate data on bullying incidents, but also for fostering a psychologically  safe campus culture. E-GUIDANCE CONNECT seeks to bridge this institutional gap  by offering an integrated system that empowers students to speak up while  enabling school counselors and administrators to act swiftly and  empathetically.</p>

<p><strong>4.  Objectives of the Study</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>General objective provides clear intent: to design a       confidential, supportive system.</li>
  <li>Specific objectives are relevant but need alignment in       tone and phrasing for academic precision.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Use consistent verb forms such as “To develop,” “To       implement,” “To provide” across objectives.</li>
  <li>Expand objective 5 by specifying the analytical tools       or techniques to be used (e.g., trend analysis or data visualization).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General  Objective</strong><br>
To design, develop, and deploy a  secure, anonymous digital reporting platform that empowers students at Filamer  Christian University to disclose bullying incidents without fear, while  enabling counselors and administrators to act promptly and effectively through  integrated data management, emotional support mechanisms, and responsive  intervention workflows.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Objectives</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><strong>To implement a secure, anonymous digital reporting       system</strong> that allows students to       disclose bullying incidents without revealing their identity, directly       addressing the <em>absence of an anonymous digital channel</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>To integrate emotional support resources within the       platform</strong>, such as counselor access,       response prompts, and guided mental health content, in response to the <em>limited       support and follow-up mechanisms for victims</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>To design reporting forms and backend processes that       accommodate online harassment</strong> through features like category tagging, timestamp logging, and secure       digital evidence submission—answering the <em>inefficiency in addressing       cyberbullying cases</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>To establish user-centered interface design and       anonymity safeguards</strong> that       reduce fear of exposure and judgment, directly combating the <em>fear of       social reprisal and stigma</em> associated with manual reporting.</li>
  <li><strong>To build a centralized system that enables real-time       notification, counselor routing, and report monitoring</strong>, thereby resolving the <em>lack of an integrated       response framework</em> and improving intervention speed and accuracy.</li>

</div>
<p><strong>5.  Theoretical Framework</strong><br>
    <strong>Comments:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Rich integration of psychological, sociological, and       technological theories: Bandura, Maslow, Davis, Cohen &amp; Felson.</li>
  <li>The application of each theory to system design is       clearly articulated.</li>
  <li>However, some sections contain repetitive statements or       off-track phrasing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Remove duplicates and consolidate key arguments - for       example, references to Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) appear twice.</li>
  <li>Link theories more explicitly to system modules.</li>
  <li>Consider adding newer behavioral or design-related       theories for digital platforms (e.g., Nudge Theory for engagement).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
