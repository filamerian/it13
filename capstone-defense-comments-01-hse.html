  <h2> Summary</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="images/capstone-defense-01.png" width="200" height="200" align="right">HSE-Archive proposes a focused and relevant web-based archive for The Hillside Echo. The proposal identifies clear needs for preservation, searchable access, alumni engagement, and features such as publication modules, alumni directory, and a feedback mechanism. Strengths include a clear problem statement, a useful conceptual framework, and a reasonable methodology using Agile. Areas to improve are making objectives outcome-focused, adding a clear ERD and database schema, tightening the literature synthesis, providing concrete sprint plans and deliverables, and adding measurable acceptance targets for evaluation.  </p>
